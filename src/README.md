- create the demo application with create-react-app: `npx create-react-app demo-app`
- move into the demo-app directory `cd demo-app`
- install react-bootstrap and bootstrap `npm install react-bootstrap bootstrap`
- clean up the new app scaffolding by deleting the content of App.css, making the App content render the react-bootstrap <Container> component only
- import the react-bootstrap css into index.js for it to be readily accessible by the whole app
